HTML File: "hello, world"
Overview
This is a basic HTML page that includes a table, a form with a text input, and other various elements such as lists, a link, an image, and a video player.

File Structure:
HTML: This file defines the structure of the webpage.
CSS: External styling is linked via styles.css.
JavaScript: Functionality is linked via script.js.
Features
1. Table of Elements
The page includes a table with headers representing elements from a game (Electro, Dendro, Geo, etc.). Below the headers are rows with characters that correspond to these elements.

2. Form Submission
A simple form is present where users can input their name. When the form is submitted, JavaScript can handle the event (as referenced by script.js).

html
Copy code
<form>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Name">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
3. List Items
Two types of lists are present: an ordered list (ol) and an unordered list (ul), displaying basic text content.

Ordered List:
ayoooo
wasssupp
Unordered List:
hello
mhm mhmhmh
4. Link
There's a link on the page that points to a humorous YouTube video.

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here for 1 million dollars$$</a>
5. Image
An image with the alternative text "Eva-01 getting humbled" is included, but the file path appears to be local, which may not display on a web server unless the image is correctly linked.

html
Copy code
<img src="C:\Users\Eva-07\OneDrive\Pictures\BlackBerry\ImpAI Optimus.png" alt="Eva-01 getting humbled" />
6. Video
A video element is present with autoplay and muted attributes, but no source is defined. This could be modified to include a proper video file.

html
Copy code
<video controls muted autoplay>
    <source src="" type="video/webm">
</video>
7. Miscellaneous Elements
There is an invalid hl tag, which should be fixed as there’s no such tag in HTML. It could be replaced with a h1, h2, or a valid tag.
html
Copy code
<hl>Halllow</hl>
Issues
Invalid HTML Tags:

The <hl> tag should be replaced with a valid tag (like <h1>).
Image Source:

The image source path is a local file, which won’t display unless hosted or linked properly.
Video Source:

The video source is missing, and the autoplay attribute is generally discouraged due to user experience issues.
Input Tag Error:

The input tag has an incorrect attribute types instead of type. It should be:
html
Copy code
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Name">
How to Use
Open the HTML file: You can open the HTML file in any browser.
Link external files: Ensure that styles.css and script.js are properly linked and exist in the same directory.
Form interaction: When the form is submitted, ensure script.js handles the event and prevents the default form submission behavior.
